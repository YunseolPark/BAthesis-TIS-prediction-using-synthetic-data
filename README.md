## Description
The main goals of the research effort presented in this project are as follows:
- Identify meaningful features of the TIS prediction model.
- Compare the true black-box model with the synthetic black-box model.
- Investigate the effect of noisy data on the TIS prediction.

In order to achieve these goals, the following steps are taken:
1. Generate the TIS synthetic dataset.
2. Train the model with real and synthetic data (_A. thaliana_).
3. Compare the results of the models trained on real and synthetic data.
4. Perform feature analysis.
5. Train the prediction model with noisy data.
